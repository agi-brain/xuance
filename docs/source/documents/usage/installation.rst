            cd xuance
            pip install -e .[all]

.. attention::

    Some extra packages should be installed manually for further usage.
    See `Install external dependencies <#id1>`_

.. error::

    During the installation of XuanCe, you might encount the following error:

    .. code-block:: bash

        Error: Failed to building wheel for mpi4py
        Failed to build mpi4py
        ERROR: Could not build wheels for mpi4py, which is required to install pyproject.toml-based projects

    **Solution 1**: You can solve that issue by install mpi4py manually via

    .. code-block:: bash

        conda install mpi4py

    **Solution 2**: If that doesn't work, you can type and install ``gcc_linux-64`` via:

    .. code-block:: bash

        conda install gcc_linux-64

    And then, retype the installation command for mpi4py via pip:

    .. code-block:: bash

        pip install mpi4py

.. tip::

    If your IP address is in Chinese mainland, you can install it with a mirror image to speed up the installation,
    for example, you can choose one of the following commands to finish installation.

    .. code-block:: bash

        pip install xuance -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
        pip install xuance -i https://pypi.mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/simple

Test the installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------

After installing XuanCe, you can enter the Python runtime environment by typing "python" in the terminal.
Then, test the installation of xuance by typing:

.. code-block:: python

    import xuance


.. error::

    If you are using Windows OS to import xuance, you might get an error likes this:

    .. code-block:: bash

        ...
        from mpi4py import MPI
        ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.

    You can address the issue by the following steps:

    **Step 1**: Download Microsoft MPI v10.0 from `Official Microsoft Download Center <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=57467>`_.

    **Step 2**: Remember to choose both "msmpisetup.exe" and "msmpisdk.msi" options, then click "Download" button and install the ".exe" file.

    **Step 3**: Reinstall mpi4py:

    .. code-block:: bash

        pip uninstall mpi4py
        pip install mpi4py


If no errors or warnings appear, XuanCe has been successfully installed.
You can move on to the next step and begin using it. (`Move to next page <basic_usage.html>`_)

The `StarCraft multi-agent challenge (SMAC) <../api/environments/multi_agent_env/smac.html>`_ is `WhiRL's <https://whirl.cs.ox.ac.uk/>`_ environment for research of cooperative MARL algorithms.
SMAC uses StarCraft II, a real-time strategy game developed by Blizzard Entertainment, as its underlying environment.

**Step 1: Install the smac python package**

You can install the SMAC package directly from the GitHub:

.. tabs::

    .. tab:: Method 1

        .. code-block:: bash

            pip install git+https://github.com/oxwhirl/smac.git

    .. tab:: Method 2

        .. code-block:: bash

            git clone https://github.com/oxwhirl/smac.git
            cd smac/
            pip install -e .


**Step 2: Install StarCraft II**

.. tabs::

    .. tab:: Linux

        Please use the `Blizzard's repository <https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto?tab=readme-ov-file#downloads>`_
        to download the Linux version of StarCraft II.

    .. tab:: Windows/MacOS

        You need to first install StarCraft II from `BATTAL.NET <https://battle.net/>`_
        or `https://starcraft2.blizzard.com <http://battle.net/sc2/en/legacy-of-the-void/>`_.

.. note::

    You would need to set the SC2PATH environment variable with the correct location of the game.
    By default, the game is expected to be in ~/StarCraftII/ directory.
    This can be changed by setting the environment variable SC2PATH.

**Step 3: SMAC Maps**

Once you have installed ``smac`` and StarCraft II, you need to download the
`SMAC Maps <https://github.com/oxwhirl/smac/releases/download/v0.1-beta1/SMAC_Maps.zip>`_,
and extract it to the ``$SC2PATH/Maps$`` directory.
If you installed ``smac`` via git, simply copy the ``SMAC_Maps`` directory
from ``smac/env/starcraft2/maps/`` into ``$SC2PATH/Maps`` directory.

It serves as a testbed for studying cooperative, competitive, and mixed interaction among multiple agents, such as robots.
The environment is designed to model tasks commonly found in real-world warehouses,
such as navigation, item retrieval, obstacle avoidance, and task allocation.

.. tabs::

    .. tab:: From PyPI

        .. code-block::

            pip install rware

    .. tab:: From GitHub Repository

        .. code-block::

            git clone git@github.com:uoe-agents/robotic-warehouse.git

            pip install -e .

    .. tab:: From XuanCe

        .. code-block::

            pip install xuance[rware]


gym-pybullet-drones
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. tip::

    Before preparing the software packages for this simulator, it is recommended to create a new conda environment with **Python 3.10**.

Open terminal and type the following commands, then a new conda environment for xuance with drones could be built:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create -n xuance_drones python=3.10
    conda activate xuance_drones
    pip install xuance  # refer to the installation of XuanCe.

    git clone https://github.com/utiasDSL/gym-pybullet-drones.git
    cd gym-pybullet-drones/
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -e .  # if needed, `sudo apt install build-essential` to install `gcc` and build `pybullet`

During the installation of gym-pybullet-drones, you might encounter the errors like:

.. error::

    | gym-pybullet-drones 2.0.0 requires numpy<2.0,>1.24, but you have numpy 1.22.4 which is incompatible.
    | gym-pybullet-drones 2.0.0 requires scipy<2.0,>1.10, but you have scipy 1.7.3 which is incompatible.

**Solution**: Upgrade the above incompatible packages.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install numpy==1.24.0
    pip install scipy==1.12.0

DCG algorithm dependency (torch-scatter)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The DCG algorithm in the XuanCe project relies on the torch-scatter library.
In most cases, you can install it directly using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install torch-scatter

However, on certain systems (e.g., specific operating systems or hardware environments),
this command may result in installation errors.
To ensure compatibility, follow the steps below to correctly install torch-scatter:

**1. Check Your PyTorch and CUDA Versions**

Use the following command to check the installed version of PyTorch and CUDA in your environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__, torch.version.cuda)"

Take note of the PyTorch version (e.g., 2.0.1) and the CUDA version (e.g., 11.8) as they will be needed to select the appropriate version of torch-scatter.

**2. Refer to the Official torch-scatter Installation Guide**

Visit the `official torch-scatter installation page <https://pypi.org/project/torch-scatter/>`_ (internet connection required).
Find the installation command that matches your PyTorch and CUDA versions. For example:

- If your PyTorch version is 2.0.1 and CUDA version is 11.8, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install torch-scatter -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.0.1+cu118.html

- If you are using the CPU-only version of PyTorch, choose the +cpu installation link, such as:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install torch-scatter -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.0.1+cpu.html

**3. Troubleshooting Compatibility Issues**

If you encounter issues during installation, ensure the following:
- PyTorch is correctly installed and the version matches the selected torch-scatter wheel.
- Your Python and pip versions are up to date. You can update pip using:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m pip install --upgrade pip

**4. Verify Installation**

After installation, verify that torch-scatter is installed successfully by running:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -c "import torch_scatter; print('torch-scatter installed successfully')"
