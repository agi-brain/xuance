^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: ../../../../_static/figures/smac/smac.png

The StarCraft multi-agent challenge (SMAC) is `WhiRL's <https://whirl.cs.ox.ac.uk/>`_ environment for research of cooperative MARL algorithms.
SMAC uses StarCraft II, a real-time strategy game developed by Blizzard Entertainment, as its underlying environment.

**GitHub repository:** `**https://github.com/oxwhirl/smac.git** <https://github.com/oxwhirl/smac.git>`_

Installation
''''''''''''''''

Step 1: Install the SMAC python package
.........................................

You can install the SMAC directly from the GitHub:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/oxwhirl/smac.git

Or you can clone the GitHub repository and install it with its dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/oxwhirl/smac.git
    cd smac/
    pip install -e .

Step 2: Install StarCraft II
...............................

**Linux**

Please use the `Blizzard's repository <https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto?tab=readme-ov-file#downloads>`_
to download the Linux version of StarCraft II.

**Windows/MacOS**

You need to first install StarCraft II from `BATTAL.NET <https://battle.net/>`_
or `https://starcraft2.blizzard.com <http://battle.net/sc2/en/legacy-of-the-void/>`_.

.. note::

    You would need to set the SC2PATH environment variable with the correct location of the game.
    By default, the game is expected to be in ~/StarCraftII/ directory.
    This can be changed by setting the environment variable SC2PATH.

Step 3: SMAC Maps
...............................

Once you have installed ``smac`` and StarCraft II, you need to download the
`SMAC Maps <https://github.com/oxwhirl/smac/releases/download/v0.1-beta1/SMAC_Maps.zip>`_,
and extract it to the ``$SC2PATH/Maps$`` directory.
If you installed ``smac`` via git, simply copy the ``SMAC_Maps`` directory
from ``smac/env/starcraft2/maps/`` into ``$SC2PATH/Maps`` directory.
